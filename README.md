# TODO List - Unit testing project
This project has been created and maintained by [@MisterGoodDeal](https://github.com/MisterGoodDeal), [@ThomasGeoffron](https://github.com/ThomasGeoffron) and [@Haborym](https://github.com/Haborym) for the course `Test unitaire @ ESGI`.

*This project is the backend of the [React App `todo-list-esgi-react`](https://github.com/MisterGoodDeal/todo-list-esgi-react), please also refer to this project.*

## Getting started

Install all dependencies using `npm`.
```bash
npm install # Or `npm i`
```

## Database 

You must start a database locally before starting the project. You can import the database from the `todo_list.sql` file in the root directory.

Then you have to set the `.env` file with the following variables:
```bash
MYSQL_HOST=your_host
MYSQL_USER=your_user
MYSQL_PASSWORD=your_password
MYSQL_PORT=3306 # 3306 is the default port, change it if necessary
MYSQL_DB=todo_list
```

## Available commands

Start the project locally using nodemon (*nodemon is a tool that helps develop node.js based applications by automatically restarting the node application when file changes in the directory are detected*).
```bash
npm run start:dev
```

Build the project for production (It'll create a folder called `/build` in the root directory).
```bash
npm run build
```

Build and start the project
```bash
npm start
```

## Testing the app

In order to perform unit testing, we're using the [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) testing framework.

Every test can be found in the `src/tests` directory.

We are testing 4 main components:
- The user model
- The todo model
- The email service (It's not a real service, it's just a mock)
- The helpers functions

**‚ö†Ô∏è You don't need to start the database in order to run tests. If you don't start it, you might have error logs, but it's fine, don't worry about it. üôÉ**

Here's the command to run the tests:
```bash
npm run test # Run the tests with all logs and warning

npm run slient-test # Run the tests without logs and warning
```
